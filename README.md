# User Interface Project: Great Idea Web Page 

Being able to create a user interface from a design file is considered a basic necessity for front end developers. We will be building a single page website using HTML and CSS. 

Given this [design file](design-files/desktop.jpg), use CSS to style the web page layout. Remember, you can only use `display:inline-block` and box model CSS properties for layout.
